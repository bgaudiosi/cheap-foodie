After logging in and searching for something, the user may find an item or place that catches their eye. The user can then click on the link and bring them to a new page. This page will display a picture of the restaurant (if available), contact information, distance from the user, and a menu to look at other items offered by this restaurant. While still on the page, the user may decide to call the restaurant and order something. After doing so, they will have the option to leave a review of the restaurant and ‘star’ or ‘like’ the restaurant, saving it to their personal list and giving them easy access if they’d like to order again from here later. At the bottom, similar restaurants will be recommended.
